Python handles memory management automatically through its garbage collection mechanism, but it also provides developers with tools to manage memory more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Automatic Memory Management (Garbage Collection)\n",
    "\n",

    "✅ 1. Frees System Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "- Files consume system-level resources (like file handles).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Closing the file releases those resources back to the OS.\n",

    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "- In write (w) or append (a) mode, changes may be buffered and not written immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "- close() ensures all buffered data is flushed to disk.\n",

    "⚠️ 1. Memory Leaks\n",
    "\n",
    "- Caused when objects are unintentionally kept alive due to lingering references.\n",

    "\n",
    "⚠️ 2. Inefficient Memory Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python's high-level abstractions (lists, dictionaries, objects) may use more memory than low-level languages like C.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data structures can become memory-heavy if not optimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ 3. Circular References\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reference counting alone can’t handle them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python's garbage collector detects and collects these, but it's not always perfect or fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ 4. Unreleased Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "- Objects like file handles, DB connections, or sockets consume memory if not explicitly closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ 5. Global Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keeping large objects in the global scope may delay garbage collection or increase memory footprint unnecessarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ 6. Misuse of C Extensions or Third-party Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some C-based libraries may not integrate well with Python’s garbage collector, leading to leaks.\n",
